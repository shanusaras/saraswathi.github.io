## Projects
### Hotel Revenue and Operational Efficiency Analysis
[Project link](https://github.com/shanusaras/Hotel-Revenue-and-Operational-Efficiency-Dashboard.git)

Atliq Grands, a luxury hotel chain, faced declining revenue due to rising competition and poor management decisions. Using Power BI, Excel, and DAX, I analyzed 12 months of booking data, uncovering key revenue drivers and inefficiencies. The insights revealed that Elite customers and the RT2 room type contributed significantly to revenue, while high cancellation rates impacted occupancy. My dashboard provided actionable strategies, including personalized marketing, optimized pricing, and stronger platform partnerships. These recommendations aimed to boost revenue, enhance customer retention, and improve operational efficiency.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
